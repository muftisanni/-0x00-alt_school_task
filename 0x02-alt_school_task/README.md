### 02- Redactr - Scramble some words from a body of text content

Project done during Frontend Software Engineering studies at **ALTSCHOOL AFRICA SCHOOL OF ENGINEERING**. In this project, I used `HTML`, `CSS` and `JavaScript` to build a web app that could help you safely share content on social media by scrambling portions of texts you wouldn't want the world to see/read.

## Scenario

[Redactr-App](https://redactr-app.succynice.repl.co/) is to help people safely share content on social media by scrambling portions of the text they don’t want the world to read/see. A user will write/paste some content into a form field and then specify the words they need to be scrambled (using another field). **Note** the user is allowed to specify more than one word (separated by space) to be scrambled.

## Outcome
After clicking a “Redact Now” button, the app scans through the original text and replaces the specified words to be scrambled with asterisks (i.e ***)

## Advanced features

*User can specify what to use in replacing the words, then the app can do the scrambling with what the user provides, be it asterisks, questions marks, dashes, underscores, or even other words
* Displays some stats like how many words were scanned, how many matched the words to be scrambled, how many characters were scrambled in total, how long it took (in seconds) to complete the scrambling task e.t.c.
